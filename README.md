<h2>👩‍💻 About Me</h2>

I’m Layan — a passionate software engineer and full-stack developer who loves turning ideas into real digital products.

I enjoy working across the stack — from crafting elegant user interfaces to building scalable backend systems — and recently I’ve been exploring AI-powered applications, product design, and rapid prototyping.

I believe technology becomes meaningful when it solves real problems and creates value.
